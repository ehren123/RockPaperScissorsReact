# Introduction

This is a simple rock paper scissors game. Games are stored to a database. There is a leaderboard as well.

# Technologies

- React with typescript

# Limitations and possible improvements

- This is not intended to be a secure application. As such cors is disabled and there is no authenticaiton.
- The UX is rather basic but get's the job done.
- React configuration done inside a typescript file.
- Database connection string hard coded in backend application.
- Leader board does not use pagination.
